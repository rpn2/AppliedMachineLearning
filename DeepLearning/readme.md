Deep learning examples using Tensorflow

1) Customize the mnist tutorial (original_mnist.py) from Tensorflow to improve the accuracy by adding convolutional layers, batch normalization, changing filter size, Adam optimizer etc,. (mnist_customized.py). The accuracy was improved from 95.5% to 99.12%

2) Looked at accuracy of cifar10 model from Tensorflow and plotted accuracy curves.
