Project to demonstrate Expectation Maximization by coding the algorithm for various applications

Part1: Document clustering

multi_EM.py 

1)Cluster the given documents to 30 topics, using a simple mixture of multinomial topic model

2) Produced a table showing top 10 words in each topic

3) Produced a graph showing, for each topic, the probabbility with which topic was selected


Part 2: Image segmentation 

Part2Final.R : Image segmentation using Expectation maximization, produce images by varying the number of clusters
